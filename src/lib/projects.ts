    With a larger team of 3 people instead of just 2, we had a lot more time to focus on the design and polish. We also had a lot more time to work on the pitch, which was a huge part of the judging process. We were able to create a pitch that was both informative and entertaining, which was a huge part of our success.`,

    Note: Please do note that if you can't run the demo, that's totally normal since your browser most likely doesn't have WebGPU enabled by default! You can preview the demo in the Youtube video provided.`,
